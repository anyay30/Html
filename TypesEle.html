    <h1 alignment="center">TYPES OF ELEMENTS</h1>
    <p>The two types of elements are Block and Inline Elements.</p>
    <p><b>Block-level Elements</b><br>
<p>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.<br>
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).<br> 
Commonly used block elements are paragraph and division,hr,ol,ul,table,nav,header etc.</p>
<p>The div element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
The div element has no required attributes but style, class and id are common.</p>
Example:
<div style="background-color:rgb(179, 95, 95);color:white;padding:20px;width:50%">
    <h2>Abes College</h2>
    <p>Sports,clubs,events,interships,placements.</p>
  </div>
<p><b>Inline Elements</b></p>
<p>An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.<br>
Commonly used inline elements are span,button,sub,sup,textarea etc.
