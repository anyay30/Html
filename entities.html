    <p>Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with entities:

        < (less than) = &lt;
        > (greather than) = &gt;
        HTML Character Entities
        Some characters are reserved in HTML.<br>
        
        If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your HTML text, the browser might mix them with tags.<br>
        
        Entity names or entity numbers can be used to display reserved HTML characters.<br>
        
        Entity names look like this:
        
        &entity_name;
        Entity numbers look like this:
        
        &#entity_number;
        To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60;<br>
        
        Entity names are easier to remember than entity numbers.
        
        Non-breaking Space
        A commonly used HTML entity is the non-breaking space: &nbsp;<br>
        
        A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.<br>
        
        Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive.<br>
        <h5>Examples:</h5>
        <p>The copyright sign: &copy;</p>
        <p>The ampersand sign: &amp;</p>
        <p>The Cent sign: &cent;</p>
        <p>The Pound sign: &pound;</p>
        <h4>HTML Special Character Example</h4>

<p>An a with a grave accent: a&#768;</p>
<p>An a with a accent: a&#771;</p>
